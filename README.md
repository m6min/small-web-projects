# 💻 Small Web Projects

This repository is a collection of small web projects I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to apply the technologies I learn and develop my skills in writing clean, well-organized code.

### [Portfolio Site](portfolio-site/)

This folder holds the source code for an simple example of a portfolio website. 


* **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3 (using Media Queries for responsiveness), JavaScript.
* **Note:** Nothing too fancy, just a fun experiment to challenge myself after stop coding for 2 years :))

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Responsiveness** | **Works good on mobile and laptops, tablets are still a work in progress though** |
